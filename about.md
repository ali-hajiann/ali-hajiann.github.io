I am a PhD student in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I started my PhD journey in Fall 2024, when I joined [Dr. Mohammad Atari's Culture and Morality Lab (CAM-L)](https://websites.umass.edu/matari/?_gl=1%2A9n0qgu%2A_gcl_au%2AMTYwNzgxNzQyNy4xNzU0NjA2NjA2%2A_ga%2AMTAzODg0NzM2OC4xNzU0NjA2NjA2%2A_ga_21RLS0L7EB%2AczE3NTQ2MDY2MDUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQ2MDY2MDUkajYwJGwwJGgw).

At CaML, we use an intercultural and historical lens to investigate morality and moral decision-making. My research focuses on the role morality plays in conflict between groups of people, both in the past and present.

When I am not busy with research and all academia has to offer, you can find me reading a Sci-Fi or Fantasy book, or binge watching a show. Feel free to contact me about my research or my favorite pieces of media!
