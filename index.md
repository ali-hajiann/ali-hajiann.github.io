"Hello World!"

Welcome to my website. You can find my CV, (some of) the academic projects I have worked on, and my contact information by navigating the buttons at the top of the page. I love engaging conversations, so do not hesitate to [shoot an email](mailto:ahajian@umass.edu) whether you are just starting your undergrad or preparing for retirement!

I am fascinated by how humans rely on a variety of cultural resources (e.g., morality, social norms) to facilitate cooperation and group-living. I am further interested in how these cultural resources shift in response to threats and shocks (natural disasters, violent conflict, social tension). I plan to investigate these topics in different societies in different periods of time, to assess how universal or particular their relationships are.
